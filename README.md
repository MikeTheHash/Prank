# Prank

Hi! This is a small script to prank your friends, I want to specify that the script does not cause any serious damage to the computer, it can at most cause the slower computers to crash as it creates a thousand text files in the folder where it is run, use it well!  For example by having your teacher perform it
## Make sure the person running the .exe has .NET installed
Sooo... nothing, enjoy!
